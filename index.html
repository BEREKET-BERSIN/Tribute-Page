            <p>Chan Kong-sang (Chinese: 陳港生; born 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Konger
                martial artist, actor, film director, producer, stuntman, and singer. He is known in the cinematic world
                for
                his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts, which he
                typically performs himself. He has trained in Wushu or Kung Fu and Hapkido, and has been acting since
                the
                1960s, appearing in over 150 films.</p>

            <p>Chan is one of the most recognisable and influential cinematic personalities in the world, gaining a
                widespread following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres, and has received stars on the Hong
                Kong
                Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons,
                and
                video games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having
                released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred. He
                is
                also a globally known philanthropist and has been named as one of the top 10 most charitable celebrities
                by
                Forbes magazine. In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was "perhaps" the "most recognised
                star in the world".[11] In 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes"
                    target="_blank">Forbes</a>
                estimated his net worth to be $350 million, and as of 2016, he was the second-highest paid actor in the
                world.</p>
            <p>Chan was born on 7 April 1954 in Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from
                the
                Chinese Civil War. His parents nicknamed him Pao-pao (Chinese: 炮炮 'Cannonball') because the energetic
                child
                was always rolling around.[14] His parents worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, and Chan spent
                his
                formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.[15]

                Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after
                which
                his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work
                as
                the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera
                School
                run by Master Yu Jim-yuen.[15][16] Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial
                arts
                and acrobatics.[17] He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up
                of
                the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close
                friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, and the three of them later became known as
                the
                Three Brothers or Three Dragons.[18] After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got
                the
                opportunity to train in hapkido under the grand master Jin Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a black
                belt.[5] Jackie Chan also trained in other styles of martial arts such as Karate, Judo, Taekwondo and
                Jeet
                Kune Do.

                Chan joined his parents in Canberra in 1976, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a
                construction worker.[19] A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, thus earning Chan the
                nickname of "Little Jack" that was later shortened to "Jackie", and the name Jackie Chan has stuck with
                him
                ever since.[20] In the late 1990s, Chan changed his Chinese name to Fong Si-lung (Chinese: 房仕龍), since
                his
                father's original surname was Fong.</p>

                    are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                    plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
